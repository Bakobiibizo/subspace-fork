#![cfg(test)]

//! Tests for the governance pallet migrations.
//! 
//! This module contains tests for the treasury address migration (MigrateToV3).
//! The migration updates the DAO treasury address to a new address due to
//! the original multi-sig holders forking the network and being uncooperative.
//!
//! The tests verify that:
//! 1. The treasury address is correctly updated during migration
//! 2. The migration is idempotent (can be run multiple times without side effects)
//! 3. The migration emits the correct event
//! 4. The migration handles error cases gracefully
