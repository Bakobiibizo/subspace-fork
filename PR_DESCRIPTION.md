# Treasury Migration Implementation Fixes

## Overview
This PR addresses critical security issues in the treasury migration implementation by fixing the public key format and adding validation measures to ensure the migration proceeds correctly.

## Changes

### 1. Fixed Public Key Format
- Corrected the public key bytes in the migration code to match the SS58 address `5GZfkfjD46SmDrnWZbrzkxkYzeJUWKTAB1HvHBurrPc7XcEj`
- The previous implementation used ASCII values of the address characters, which would result in an invalid account ID
- The correct binary representation has been verified using the substrate-interface library

### 2. Enhanced Validation and Error Handling
- Added validation to ensure the public key format is correct before using it
- Implemented checks to prevent migration if the new treasury address is invalid or unchanged
- Enhanced error logging with detailed messages
- Added fallback to default account with clear error messages if decoding fails

### 3. Added Security Audit Trail
- Implemented event emission for the treasury address update, providing an on-chain audit trail
- This allows for verification of the migration through block explorers

### 4. Weight Calculation Analysis
- Conducted a thorough investigation of weight calculations in the codebase
- Analyzed benchmarking code and weight patterns in the governance pallet
- Added detailed comments explaining the weight calculation rationale

### 5. Created Validation Tool
- Developed a Python script (`validate_replacement_key.py`) that:
  - Validates the public key bytes against the SS58 address
  - Formats the output in a clear, tabular format for easy comparison
  - Can automatically write the correct bytes to the migration code
  - Features a rich-formatted help menu

### 6. Updated Documentation
- Enhanced the treasury migration documentation to include:
  - Additional validation steps in the implementation details
  - Information about the weight calculation analysis
  - Information about the new validation tool
  - Usage examples for the validation tool

## Testing
- Validated the public key bytes using the new validation tool
- Verified that the bytes match the SS58 address `5GZfkfjD46SmDrnWZbrzkxkYzeJUWKTAB1HvHBurrPc7XcEj`
- Tested the validation tool's write functionality to ensure it correctly updates the migration code

## Security Considerations
- The migration now includes multiple layers of validation to ensure the treasury address is correctly updated
- Error handling has been improved to prevent silent failures
- Event emission provides an audit trail for the migration
